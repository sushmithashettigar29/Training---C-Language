2.Double declining balance method of depreciation (Reference: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/double-declining-balance-depreciation-method.asp)

2.Function to calculate depreciation amount of an asset using straight line depreciation method for a given amount and number of years
3.Function to calculate depreciation amount of an asset using double declining balance method for a given amount and number of years
4.Function to write output in the format
